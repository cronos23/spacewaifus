# spacewaifus
Humorous space adventure game made as a school project.
## DISCLAIMER! 
I do not take ANY credit for the Assets, Course or CourseTests part, my contribution is solely to the Student and StudentTests modules. This project was developed on top of code provided by course personnel with some loose guidelines. The game was made with some help from my project partner Valtteri Setälä, and sprites made by Elias Wuoti.
